Suppose a high school student asks us for help slving several quadraic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The quadratic formula gives us the solutions:

which of course change depending on the values of a, b and c. One advantage of programming languages is that we can define variables and write expressions with these variables, similar to how we do so in math, but obtain a numeric solution. We will write out general code for the quadratic eqation below, but if we are asked to solve x^2 + x - 1 = 0, then we define:


```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1

```

which stores the values for later use. We use <- to assign values to the variables.

We can also assign values using = instead of <-, but we recommend against using = to avoid confusion.
